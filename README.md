## uds-syntax-highlighter

This is a simple syntax highlighter for Qt-based code editors. Although it works pretty well, it is by no means complete. It has complete support for custom syntax files and themes. To build, run the CMake file, and for an example, run the binary in the "src" directory once everything is built.

I do plan to eventually improve this some more by making it into a more complete library and possibly integrating it with something.
